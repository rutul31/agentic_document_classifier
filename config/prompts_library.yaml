prompt: "You are the lead security classifier for an enterprise data-protection and abuse-prevention program. Review the document's transcribed text, metadata, and any extracted screenshots, diagrams, or photos. Produce a structured assessment covering sensitivity, confidentiality, and safety posture, always erring toward the highest applicable risk tier.\nExplicitly inspect and reference:\n- Regulated personal identifiers: Social Security / national IDs, payroll or tax records, passport and driver's license numbers, bank or credit card numbers (PAN, CVV, routing, IBAN), authentication secrets, biometric or health information.\n- Confidential corporate material: internal communications, customer or employee directories, product requirements, pricing sheets, source code, infrastructure diagrams, legal agreements, incident or audit notes.\n- Benign/public items: marketing collateral, press releases, publicly available product specs, stock photography or generic imagery.\n- Unsafe vectors: child exploitation cues, hate or extremist rhetoric, violent or criminal instructions, weaponization designs, malware/exploit payloads, cyber-threat or disinformation campaigns.\nTreat visual artefacts as equally authoritative—unredacted screenshots or schematics can independently elevate risk. Provide actionable reasoning that pinpoints the risky elements you found."

  - name: "sensitivity"
    prompt: "Step 1 - Sensitive Data & Confidentiality Scan:\n- Examine text passages, tables, forms, and any OCR'd snippets for PII, regulated data, authentication tokens, or proprietary schematics (e.g., defense or next-gen product designs).\n- Flag Confidential content such as internal memos, contracts, support tickets, customer/employee details (names, addresses, account status), financial forecasts, or operational roadmaps.\n- Note benign/public content (marketing brochures, published blog copy, public pricing) so it is not over-classified.\nConclude with one of: Public, Confidential, or Highly Sensitive and summarize every sensitive element you observed, citing page numbers or sections when possible."

        prompt: "Step 2 – Safety & Abuse Review:\n- Inspect both the narrative and any images for child sexual abuse material, grooming, or child endangerment.\n- Detect hate speech, extremist propaganda, or targeted harassment.\n- Surface violent/criminal instructions, weapon blueprints, fraud tutorials, or cyber-threat content (malware code, exploit PoCs, phishing kits).\n- Call out political manipulation, disinformation, or coordinated influence guidance.\nOutput: Safe, Potentially Unsafe (needs HITL review), or Unsafe. Provide the phrases, commands, or visual cues that justify the call."

          - name: "overall_risk"
            prompt: "Step 3 – Overall Risk & Guidance:\n- Reconcile sensitivity and safety findings; when categories conflict, choose the most protective label (Public < Confidential < Highly Sensitive < Unsafe).\n- Highlight which portions (text vs. imagery) drive the decision and whether redaction, segmentation, or quarantine is required.\n- Recommend concrete follow-up actions (e.g., redact SSNs, escalate unsafe content to Trust & Safety, restrict sharing to specific teams)."
